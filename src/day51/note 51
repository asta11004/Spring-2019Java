// What we can have inside one Class 
	Also see -- Tuesday notes 


// Inheritance 
	
	a class can use fields and methods from another class 
	by extending it, instead of creating everything from scracth 

	IS-A Relationship 
		Student IS-A Person 
		LocalStudent IS-A Student 
		Car - Vehicle 

	What keyword to build relationship 
			public class Student extends Person{

			}

	How many class a class can extends directly 
		a class can only extend one another class directlt 
		BAD : 
		public class Student extends Person, Human, Robot{} 


	Child--> Parent--> GrandParent--> Object (class)
	
	Child c1 = new Child() ; 
	c1.everyVisibleFieldsAndMethod.....


	What's inherited from super class 
		All visible fields / methods from super class 
		Constructor IS NOT INHERITED 	

	Visibility : 
		private : ----> in same class 
		default : ----> same package 
		protected: ---> same package+sub classes outside package
		public : -----> everywhere 


	Constructor : 
		how can we call other constructors of same class
			this(arg...) 
				 it has to be first statement 
				 it can only be called once 
				 recursive calls should be avoided 
				 	-- you call me , i call you --compiler error

		how can we call super class constructor 
			super(arg...)
				 it has to be first statement 
				 it can only be called once
				 if no constructor call is made already 
				 	super() will be inserted in first line 
				 super() and this() can not show up together 
				 	in same constructor 
				 CAN NOT CALL A CONSTUCTOR that we dont have 


	super(args..)

Inheritance 

	what's inherited from super class ? 
		All visible fields and methods 
		including static fileds and instance fields 


	
	Constructors are not inherited 
		but can be accessible using super(arg..)


	this(args)  
		this is used to call current class's other constructor

	super(args)
		this is used to call super class's other constructor



	Method overriding : 
		we can override the inherited instance methods from super class in sub class to define sub class version of the method . 

		 it has to have same method name 
		 it has to have same parameter list 
		 it has to have same return type --at this moment 
		 it has to have same or more visibility 

		 if super class method has visibity of < >
		 what can be sub class access modifier 

		 public --->> public 
		 protected --->  protected , public 
		 default ----> default, protected, public 
		 private ----> ALL ! ????? ARE YOU SURE ????
		 		THERE IS NO OVERRIDING CONCEPT FOR PRIVATE METHOD, BECAUSE IT'S NOT INHERITED 



	we have been already overriding the toString() method 
	from Object class to avoid getting hashcode 

	public String toString(){
		return "your own message"; 
	}


	Create Animal class 

		with single method called 
		makeNoise accept no parameter return nothing 
		it print out general noise

	Create 2 sub classes 
		Horse 
			override makeNoise method 
			print --> Horse --- Nai Nai Nai

		Dog 
			override makeNoise method 
			print --> Dog --- Woof Woof Woof
	Create a class with main called AnimalTalentShow 

	Create 3 objects of Animal , Dog , Horse 
		 let them make noise


		 Overloading 
		 	 2 methods with same name different parameter list 
		 	 // does return type , access modifer matter??
		 	 ----- BIG NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

		 	 // does it matter it's static or instance 
		 	 ----- it does not matter 
		 	 it can be in same class or it can be in 
		 	 inherited classes 


		 Overrding 	
		 	-- Inheritance relationship Must Exists
		 	we can override super classes' instance method 
		 	in sub class to provide sub class version of action

		 	Name -->> has to be the same 
		 	Parameter List -->> has to be the same
		 		(method signature has to be the same)
		 	return type -->> same at this moment 

		 	visibility -->> has to be same or more 

		 	method overriding is a concept exclusive to 
		 	instance method
		 	CAN NOT OVERRIDE STATIC METHOD !!!!!!


Task 2 
	Create a BankAccount class 
		fields : 
			accountName as String
			accountNumber as long 
			balance as double 

		Constructor 
			3 args constructor to set all above value 

		methods : 
			toString method
			deposit accept one int as parameter 
				and it changes the balance accordingly
			withdraw accept one int as parameter
				and it changes the balance accordingly

	Create a sub class called SavingAccount 
		field : 
			double returnRate
		Constructor 
			4 args constructor to set all above value 

		overriden methods : 
			toString method
			deposit accept one int as parameter 
				and it changes the balance accordingly
				but you get 100$ for each deposit 
			withdraw accept one int as parameter
				and it changes the balance accordingly
				but you get 10$ penalty for each withdraw 



this(args..) 
	calling current class's other constructor to reuse the functionality 
VS 

super() 
	calling super class's other constructor to reuse the functionality 


// static member in inheritance 
	is static method and fields are inherited 
		YES ! they are inherited 

	public Person{
		public static string race = "Human"
	}

	public Student extends Person{
		// public static string race = "Human"
		main{
			Person.race
			race
			Student.race
		}
	}

	STATIC METHODS CAN NOT BE OVERRIDEN it can only be hiddien by declaring same method in sub class 
	if you put @Override on top it will not compile 
	


// Method overriding : 
	 you can define same method with same method signature 
	 same return type in sub class with different content 
	 in the method body to override the functionality 
	 inherited from super class 

	 Rule : 
	 	it should have same method signature 
	 	same return type --- at this moment 
	 	it can not have less visibility

	 WE CAN NOT OVERRIDE A PRIVATE METHOD 
	 WE CAN NOT OVERRIDE SOMETHING WE DON'T INHERIT 



// overriding VS overloading 

// super. 
	--> super class's instance fields and methods 

When do we use it mostly : 
	in overriden method in sub class 
	if we want to reuse the functionlity of super class version of the method and build on top of it , we can use super.methdoname to access super class version 


METHOD OVERRIDING IS A CONCEPT EXCLUSIVELY FOR 
--------->>>>> INSTANCE METHODS IN INHERITANCE RELATIONSHIP
